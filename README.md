### Task: First promises

In this task you should create 2 promises.
1. The first promise should be resolved on a `click` on `.logo`.
2. The second promise should be rejected in 3 seconds.

That's all.

Implementation tips:
- print two messages to notify a user about resolved or rejected promise;
- the message is block element with class `message` for the resolved promise and `error-message` for the rejected promise; 
- the message about resolved promise should not disappear;
- the messages should have text `Promise was resolved!` and `Promise was rejected!`.
