### Task: First promises

In this task you should create 2 promises.
1. The first promise should be resolved on a `click` in `document`.
2. The second promise should be rejected in 5 seconds.

That's all.

Hint: It doesn't matter in what way you choose to notify users about resolved or rejected promises. You can use DOM or `console.log`.
